[![Build GDrive CLI](https://github.com/puskartrital/gdrive-cli-builder/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/puskartrital/gdrive-cli-builder/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# GDrive CLI Builder
[GDrive CLI](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive) is a great tools, but because the owner is hardcoded the credentials directly to the [code](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/blob/c3cbcceedd6beb1fcff30f06ea7be7c29558d181/handlers_drive.go#L17), it's makes every one who use the [release package](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive/releases) from this project is sharing the same quota. So i try to make this repository to help who want to build the package using their own credentials.

Note: This Repo is using a Fork of GDrive in this [Repo](https://github.com/puskartrital/gdrive)

#### NOTE: Use Google Auth Playground

* Use the google auth playground to set the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and finally select the google drive v3 after that select auth scope from dropdown then authorize api then exchange the token for access_token and refresh_token but make sure to tick automatically refresh token as well. Copy the access_token and refresh_token copy it to .gdrive/token_v2.json that's it. you're 
good to go.
